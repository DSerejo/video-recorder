## Simple PWA for Video Recording and Streaming to Google Drive

### Overview
This project aims to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works both on the browser and natively on mobile devices. The app will allow users to record videos and stream them directly to Google Drive. The approach involves splitting the video into chunks while recording and streaming those chunks directly to a file in Google Drive. Each chunk will be queued to buffer slow connections, and the chunk will be deleted from memory as soon as it is uploaded successfully.

### Key Features
- Record videos directly from the browser or mobile device.
- Stream video chunks directly to Google Drive.
- Queue video chunks to handle slow connections.
- Delete chunks from memory after successful upload.

### Technical Approach
1. **Video Recording**: Use the MediaRecorder API to record video from the user's device.
2. **Chunking**: Split the recorded video into smaller chunks for easier upload and buffering.
3. **Streaming to Google Drive**: Use Google Drive API to upload video chunks directly to a file in the user's Google Drive.
4. **Queue Management**: Implement a queue to manage the upload of video chunks, ensuring smooth streaming even with slow connections.
5. **Memory Management**: Delete video chunks from memory after they have been successfully uploaded to Google Drive.

### Feasibility
Yes, it is possible to implement this approach. The MediaRecorder API allows for real-time recording and chunking of video data. The Google Drive API supports resumable uploads, which can be used to upload video chunks. By managing a queue of video chunks, we can buffer slow connections and ensure a smooth streaming experience. Memory management can be handled by deleting chunks from memory once they are uploaded successfully.

### Next Steps
1. Set up a basic PWA structure with a service worker and manifest file.
2. Implement video recording using the MediaRecorder API.
3. Develop the chunking mechanism to split recorded video into smaller parts.
4. Integrate Google Drive API for uploading video chunks.
5. Implement queue management for handling video chunk uploads.
6. Test the app on both browser and mobile devices to ensure compatibility and performance.

### Conclusion
This project will result in a simple yet powerful PWA that allows users to record and stream videos directly to Google Drive. By leveraging modern web APIs and efficient memory management techniques, we can provide a seamless experience for users on both browser and mobile platforms.
